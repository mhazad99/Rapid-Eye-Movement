"""
    Calculate the normal distribution produces by the mutual information found 
    between two signals that are not recorded at the same time during a recording. 
    This will help to evaluate if the highest MI scores found are caused by 
    randomness or if it shares enough information between the two signals.

    The null hypothesis is 2 signals share an expected (normal) mutual information.
    We want the criteria to reject the null hypothesis.
    We want the criteria to identify when 2 signals share an unexpected high mutual informaiton.
    The confidence level indicates the degree of confidence that the criteria did not occur by sampling error.
